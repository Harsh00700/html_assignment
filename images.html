	<h1>How Images Look</h1>

	<img src="medium.png">

	<p>
		Sometimes you put the image all by itself in a paragraph. If we knew CSS, we could center the image in the page. Don't be tempted use the <b>center</b> tag as it is deprecated.
	</p>

	<p>
		Images can be <img src="tiny.png"> right in the middle of text like a character. And we can even make an image a clickable <a href="lists.html"><img src="tiny.png"></a> link to another page.
	</p>
